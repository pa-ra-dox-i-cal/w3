# [WIP] Warcraft 3 Multiplayer
Growing up, many of Dekada’s raiders were shaped by Warcraft III—a game that defined an era for our community. That shared experience inspired this project: a simple, safe, and *official* way to install the game.

Too many of our players have dealt with risky installers from questionable sites, often flagged by Windows Defender or even deleting files mid-installation. This guide offers a trustworthy alternative.

I’ve shared it here on GitHub because the official FTP download can take over an hour—time better spent playing, not waiting.

Let's get back to Azeroth. Safely and swiftly.

## Installation
> [!CAUTION]
> Please read this README.md file before, during, and/or whenever you encounter hurdles while installing. If you reach out to me and ask questions that have already been answered in this README, you will be referred back here and/or ignored!
### [Warcraft III](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zngdYL0ELcJIy_casnyDqe-aIBnmYoYm/view?usp=drive_link)
Download the [Warcraft III](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zngdYL0ELcJIy_casnyDqe-aIBnmYoYm/view?usp=drive_link) installer[^1] and extract it with your preferred choice of file archiver software[^2].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reign of Chaos (RoC) should first be installed before The Frozen Throne (TFT) patch. TFT can't be installed without RoC.

> [!WARNING] 
> You will need to have your "own set of CD keys"[^3] for RoC and TFT,  respectively.</br></br>

### [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
Radmin VPN allows us to use the Local Area Network feature of Warcraft III, reminiscent of [RGC](https://rankedgaming.com/) and [Garena](https://www.garena.ph/) days for Dota 1.

## [WIP] FAQ

[^1]: Alternatively, Blizzard Classic Warcraft III official installers and official patches can be found [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/warcraft3/t/classic-warcraft-iii-official-installers-official-patches/21415).
[^2]: I personally use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) Windows x64 (64-bit), though Windows 11 already has its own file archiver software, 7-Zip is just faster in compressing/extracting compressed files.
