# [Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zngdYL0ELcJIy_casnyDqe-aIBnmYoYm/view?usp=drive_link)
Growing up, many of Dekada’s raiders were shaped by Warcraft III—a game that defined an era for our community. That shared experience inspired this project: a simple, safe, and *official* way to install the game.

Too many of our players have dealt with risky installers from questionable sites, often flagged by Windows Defender or even deleting files mid-installation. This guide offers a trustworthy alternative.

I’ve shared it here on GitHub because the official FTP download can take over an hour—time better spent playing, not waiting.

Let's get back to Azeroth. Safely and swiftly.

### Warcraft III
> [!WARNING]

Download the [Warcraft III](#requirements) installer and extract it with your preferred choice of file archiver software[^2].

### [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
Radmin VPN allows us to use the Local Area Network feature of Warcraft III, reminiscent of [RGC](https://rankedgaming.com/) and [Garena](https://www.garena.ph/) days for Dota 1.

## Multiplayer
> [!TIP]
> After you have connected to a network that you like, just go to Local Area Network inside Warcraft III, you will be able to see open lobbies.

Radmin VPN allows us to choose various connection types whether hosting private networks or joining a private/gaming network.
### Private Network
This is ideal if you want to just play with your friends and don't want strangers joining in your lobby.

#### Create Private Network

#### Join Private Network
![Join Private Network](https://github.com/pa-ra-dox-i-cal/w3/blob/main/demo/privateJoinRadmin.gif)

### Gaming (Public) Network
Ready for a new adventure? Jump into public lobbies to try maps you’ve never played. Or build your own lobby and call the shots. The public network is your playground.

## FAQ
### 1. I can hear the game audio normally, but my screen remains completely black. The game seems to be running in the background.
> [!NOTE]
> This is most likely an issue with your GPU where the resolution of the monitor and GPU mismatches. I still haven't found a better workaround than having it in windowed mode.
#### 1.1 Windowed Mode Workaround
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/pa-ra-dox-i-cal/w3/blob/main/demo/faq1.png" alt="Windowed Mode Shortcut Fix" width="350">
</p>

If you don't have a shortcut for "Frozen Throne.exe," create one.  
Right click the "Frozen Throne.exe" shortcut and go to properties.  
Under the "Shortcut" tab, click on "Target: " and go to the end of line. (e.g., "C:\Games\Warcraft III\Frozen Throne.exe")  
Type "-windowed" without the quotation marks. (e.g., "C:\Games\Warcraft III\Frozen Throne.exe" -windowed)

#### 1.2 Widescreen Fix
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/pa-ra-dox-i-cal/w3/blob/main/demo/faq1.2.png" alt="Widescreen Fix" width="700">
</p>

If the workaround in [1.1](#11-windowed-mode-workaround) did not work, try downloading and installing the [Widescreen Fix](https://github.com/ENAleksey/RenderEdge_Widescreen) for Warcraft III into your Warcraft III main folder.

[^2]: I personally use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) Windows x64 (64-bit), though Windows 11 already has its own file archiver software, 7-Zip is just faster in compressing/extracting compressed files.
